      <h3>About Me:</h3><br>   
        I'm a nerd, what can I say?
      <p></p><br>
        I love, in no particular order:
        <ul>
          <li>Video Games</li>
          <li>Anime</li>
          <li>Science Fiction</li>
          <li>anything else that could be construed as 'Geeky' or 'Nerdy'</li>
        </ul>

          I play the cello <span class="funnybad">(badly)</span>, and speak spanish <span class="funnybad">(also badly)</span>.  I live in Portland, Oregon, and <em><strong>LOVE</strong></em> it here.  I enjoy different kinds of foods (thai, especially) and am currently on a quasi-omnipresent quest to find the best restaurants in portland.  
        <p>My current top 5 are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Afuri - Izakaya</li>
          <li>The Screen Door</li>
          <li>The Fishwife</li>
          <li>Thai Ginger</li>
          <li>Gravy</li>
        </ol>
